```posh
pip install superloops
```


SuperLoops package simplifies and augments usage of Python threads.

```python
class ProcessLoop(SuperLoop):
    def cycle(self):
        # process stuff in a separate thread

loop = ProcessLoop()
loop.start()
# ProcessLoop0: Started 

loop.stop()
# ProcessLoop0: Exited gracefully

loop.hard_reset() # when nothing else helps ðŸ˜¬ 
```

Thread events?

```python
class ApiFeedLoop(SuperLoop):
    def on_start(self):
        self.api = Api(key=my_key)
        
    def on_stop(self):
        self.api.disconnect()
        
    def cycle(self):
        self.api.get_feed()

    # on_thread_start, on_thread_stop...
```

Multiple threads that need to stay healthy?

```python
loop_controller = LoopController()

process_loop = loop_controller.new_loop(ProcessLoop())
api_feed_loop = loop_controller.new_loop(ApiFeedLoop())

loop_controller.start()
# LoopController0: Started

loop_controller.maintain_loops()
# ProcessLoop0: Started
# ApiFeedLoop0: Started

api_feed_loop.failure() # oops!

# LoopController0: Stopping loops.
# ProcessLoop0: Exited gracefully
# ApiFeedLoop0: Exited gracefully

# LoopController0: Restarting loops.
# ProcessLoop1: Started
# ApiFeedLoop1: Started
```


In summary, SuperLoops provide support for thread maintenance, events, failure handling, health status propagation, and graceful termination.


## <a name="how-superloops-works"></a>How does SuperLoops work?

SuperLoop is a class that wraps around a Python `threading.Thread` object. It exposes an interface for thread starting, stopping, hard restarts, graceful termination and events: `on_start`, `on_stop`, `on_thread_start` and `on_thread_stop`.

Each time you restart a SuperLoop, it will create a new Thread, handling naming and graceful termination for you.

Aided by the LoopController class, the SuperLoops are able to communicate their health between each other. This ensures that should one SuperLoop fail and need restarting, all other connected SuperLoops would be restarted too.
